# R Programming Assignment 2
## Submitted by Shoven Shrivastava

Assignment has three files: 
1. makeCacheMatrix - This function creates a special "matrix" object that can cache its inverse
2. cacheSolve - This function computes the inverse of the special "matrix" returned by makeCacheMatrix above. If the inverse has already been calculated (and the matrix has not changed), then the cachesolve should retrieve the inverse from the cache.
Computing the inverse of a square matrix can be done with the solve function in R. For example, if X is a square invertible matrix, then solve(X) returns its inverse.
3. Assignment_2 file which has both functions in one file
